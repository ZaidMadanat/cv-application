# CV Resume Project 
This project is the first project within The Odin Project curriculum that uses React. It has been a humbling and fun experience creating this CV application. Although I don't have a download option for the CV, the most important part is that it is fully functional with the ability to update in real time and adding as much educational or job forms. 

## What I learned 
I learned how to `useState` very well and working with an array of objects. But most importantly I learned how to split my components up, which is why this project took so long. My work is split into multiple components that each connect with each other, and although I still have some ways to go before I am happy with how my project is split, I am proud of the way I organized my folder structure.
